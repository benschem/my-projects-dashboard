[X] Write a Rake task to manually fetch the data

### Views and UI

[X] Index page

## Deployment

[ ] Set up reverse proxy so NGINX forwards to localhost:9292
[ ] Use systemd service to run bundle exec rackup
[ ] Configure ENV vars
[ ] Add logging

## Polish

## Stretch Goals

[ ] Show git commit graph with git log --graph
[ ] Track last personal commit (vs contributions)
